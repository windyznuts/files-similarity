/// SIMILARITY DOCUMENTATION ///

Description :
this code uses cosine distance methode to measure similarity between two text files 
it first transfers files into strings using a buffer to store them in , calculates frequency of each word of the strings
and stores these frequencies into vectors to finally apply the cosine function and obtain similarity 


**How to run :
-navigate to file folder using cd commande 
-in commande line , type :
g++ -o similarity similarity.cpp 
to compile and generate the exe file
-to execute the code type : 
similarity <filename1.txt> <filename2.txt>
